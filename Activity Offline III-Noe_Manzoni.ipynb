Factor analysis is a technique that is used to reduce a large number of variables into fewer numbers of factors.  This technique extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score.\n"

Factor Analysis is used to understand the underlying 'cause' which these factors (latent or constituents) capture much of the information of a set of variables in the dataset data"
